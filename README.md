# CG_Midterm
 
Plane asset taken from
https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/vehicles/air/free-aircraft-pack-194025

Added Bump Mapping to the background
I changed it so that I could also modify the color of the background (you can change the color to make it look like the required volcano scene, no LUT needed)
Didn't have time to inclide the toggle

Tried to make the toon shader accept and display textures, didn't work

Tried to make the decal to change color (no longer based on texture), also didn't work

LUT script wasn't needed

No moving object

Complete failure
